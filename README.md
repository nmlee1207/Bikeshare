### Project Title
Udacity-Project--Bikeshare-Data-Analysis

### Description
This project was to create a program using python which analyses data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United State; Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Requirements included user ability to filter by one or all cities, filter by one or all months, and to filter by one or all days. There was also a requirement to provide 5 lines of raw data as well as statistics listed below. 

Data was formatted as csv files, with the following columns:
- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration 
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type

Chicago and New York City had two additional columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

Statistics provided:
- What month occurs most often in the start time?
- What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time? 
- What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
- What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
- What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
- What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of gender?
- What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?


### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

Each file has 8 columns and 300,000 rows of data.
